# React Basic Learning

Welcome to the React Learning Playground repository! This project is a one-page application built with React.js that serves as a learning platform for React beginners. It encompasses a variety of features and concepts to help you grasp the basics of React development.

⚪ Multiple Pages: The application consists of different buttons, each leading to a separate page. Each page focuses on a specific concept or topic in React, allowing you to explore and learn at your own pace.

⚪ React Hooks: Throughout the project, you'll encounter various React hooks such as useState, useContext, useEffect, useLocation, useParams, and useReducer. These hooks provide powerful functionality and help you understand the fundamentals of state management and component lifecycle.

⚪ API Integration: One of the pages demonstrates how to make API calls using both Axios and the Fetch API. You'll learn how to fetch data from an external API and handle the responses using these popular HTTP client libraries.

⚪ Google Keep Notes Project: In addition to learning individual concepts, this repository also includes a simple project inspired by Google Keep Notes. You'll get hands-on experience with component composition, state management, and user interactions.

⚪ Live Image Search Filter: Another page showcases how to implement a live image search filter using React hooks. As you type in the search box, the images are filtered in real-time based on the input.

This repository serves as an interactive playground for React beginners, providing practical examples and exercises to enhance your understanding of React concepts. By exploring the different pages and working on the Google Keep Notes project, you'll gain valuable hands-on experience in React development.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
